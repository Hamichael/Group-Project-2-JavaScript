          <p>The following requirements must be completed:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Follow the instructions in the assignment to join a team for the assignment and to get access to a remote repository.</li>
            <li>Using JavaScript code covered in lessons 1 thru 8, create a web application that provides three timers similar to the screen shot above. The web application buttons function as follows:
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Set</strong>: Prompts for minutes, minimum 1, maximum 30. The corresponding timer field is updated to reflect the number of minutes entered. While the corresponding timer is counting up/down, the <strong>Set</strong> button performs no action.</li>
                  <li><strong>Count Up</strong>: Sets the corresponding timer to 0:00 and counts up in one second intervals until the timer matches the number of minutes previously set.</li>
                  <li><strong>Count Down</strong>: Counts down the previously set corresponding timer in one second intervals until 0:00 and then ends.</li>
                  <li><strong>Stop</strong>: Stops the corresponding timer and ends the count up/down of the timer.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Before any team member starts writing HTML, CSS or JavaScript code, a file named <code>algorithm.html</code> must be created listing the algorithm (pseudocode) that will be used by the team to solve the problem(s) specified in the requirements. This file must go through the <strong>Steps to make changes</strong> process before any coding starts.</li>
            <li>A file <code>contributions.html</code> must be created that lists the name of each team member and what they did for the assignment. Each team member must follow the <strong>Steps to make changes</strong> process to add their name and their contributions to this file.</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="alert-info"><strong>Note</strong>: Each team member must contribute JavaScript code to the assignment. It is the responsibility of all team members to ensure that other team members contribute JavaScript code to the assignment.</p>
          <p class="alert-warning"><strong>Note</strong>: Commit messages must be specific. Points will be deducted for generic commit messages.</p>
